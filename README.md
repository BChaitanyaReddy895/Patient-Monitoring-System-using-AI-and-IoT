# üè• AI-IoT Smart Patient Monitoring & Alert System
A smart and scalable IoT-based health monitoring system designed using the ESP32 DevKit, capable of tracking patient vitals in real time. The system monitors heart rate, body temperature, and humidity using sensors like Pulse Sensor and DHT11, and transmits the data via Wi-Fi to ThingSpeak for cloud visualization.

# What makes this system stand out is its built-in intelligence and alerting mechanism:
a Python-based machine learning model classifies the health data as normal or abnormal.
# When an anomaly (such as fever or tachycardia) is detected, the system triggers:
    Continuous email alerts to caregivers via the Gmail API.
    Local voice alerts using a speaker module
    Visual and audio alerts using LED and buzzer
    This ensures timely intervention and is ideal for home care, elderly monitoring, and remote health support.
